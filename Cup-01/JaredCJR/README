Notice
========================

* The code in this dir does not mean it will always be correct.
    * It is the training flow that I have tried.
* I do not recommend you to re-run again the code with Anaconda.
    * Anaconda has serious issues when processing the data that need long time.
        * Sometimes, it will not work.
    * You should run directly with "$ python3"
    * As far as I know, even you run with the lastest Intel-8700K, it will takes you about more than 1 hour to reproduce to result.
